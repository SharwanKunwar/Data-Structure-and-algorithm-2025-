#Purpose:
Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code based on a condition.

#Efficiency:
Helps avoid code repetition, making the program more concise and manageable.

#Types of Loops:

1. For loop:
    When the number of iterations is known in advance.

2. While loop:
    When the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition.

3. Do-while loop:
    Ensures the block runs at least once, then checks the condition.

Why use loops:

1. Automates repetitive tasks.
2. Increases code readability and maintainability.
3. Makes the program flexible and easier to modify.
4. Reduces errors by avoiding code duplication.
